    # Summary: Create an installation access token for an app
    # Description:
    #   Creates an installation access token that enables a GitHub App to make authenticated API requests for the app's installation on an organization or individual account. Installation tokens expire one hour from the time you create them. Using an expired token produces a status code of `401 - Unauthorized`, and requires creating a new installation token. By default the installation token has access to all repositories that the installation can access. To restrict the access to specific repositories, you can provide the `repository_ids` when creating the token. When you omit `repository_ids`, the response does not contain the `repositories` key.
    #
    #   You must use a [JWT](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app) to access this endpoint.

    # Description:
    #   OAuth applications and GitHub applications with OAuth authorizations can use this API method for checking OAuth token validity without exceeding the normal rate limits for failed login attempts. Authentication works differently with this particular endpoint. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) to use this endpoint, where the username is the application `client_id` and the password is its `client_secret`. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.

You must also provide a valid OAuth `access_token` as an input parameter and the grant for the token's owner will be deleted.
    #   Deleting an application's grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated with the application for the user. Once deleted, the application will have no access to the user's account and will no longer be listed on [the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).

    #   *   **User**: The public timeline for any user, using [URI template](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia)
    #   *   **Current user public**: The public timeline for the authenticated user
    #   *   **Current user**: The private timeline for the authenticated user
    #   *   **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity created by the authenticated user
    #   *   **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.
    #   *   **Security advisories**: A collection of public announcements that provide information about security-related vulnerabilities in software on GitHub.
    #
    #   **Note**: Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating via Basic Auth](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth tokens.

    #   **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
    #   reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
    #   the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
    #   request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

    # Summary: Add or update team membership for a user
    # Description:
    #   Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.
    #
    #   Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
    #
    #   **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
    #
    #   An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.
    #
    #   If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.
    #
    #   **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

    #   Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
    #

If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."

    # Summary: Get rate limit status for the authenticated user
    # Description:
    #   **Note:** Accessing this endpoint does not count against your REST API rate limit.
    #
    #   Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For this reason, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under `resources`, you'll see objects relating to different categories:
    #   * The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
    #   * The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "[Search](https://docs.github.com/rest/search)."
    #   * The `code_search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "[Search code](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#search-code)."
    #   * The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Resource limitations](https://docs.github.com/graphql/overview/resource-limitations#rate-limit)."
    #   * The `integration_manifest` object provides your rate limit status for the `POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions` operation. For more information, see "[Creating a GitHub App from a manifest](https://docs.github.com/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest#3-you-exchange-the-temporary-code-to-retrieve-the-app-configuration)."
    #   * The `dependency_snapshots` object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "[Dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/rest/dependency-graph)."
    #   * The `code_scanning_upload` object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "[Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github)."
    #   * The `actions_runner_registration` object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners)."
    #   * The `source_import` object is no longer in use for any API endpoints, and it will be removed in the next API version. For more information about API versions, see "[API Versions](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/api-versions)."
    #
    #   **Note:** The `rate` object is deprecated. If you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the `core` object instead of the `rate` object. The `core` object contains the same information that is present in the `rate` object.

    # Summary: Mark repository notifications as read
    # Description:
    #   Marks all notifications in a repository as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the [List repository notifications for the authenticated user](https://docs.github.com/rest/activity/notifications#list-repository-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user) endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.

    # Description:
    #   **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.
    #
    #   Creates a new check run for a specific commit in a repository. Your GitHub App must have the `checks:write` permission to create check runs.
    #
    #   In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with the same name to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000, GitHub will start to automatically delete older check runs.

    # Description:
    #   **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.
    #
    #   By default, check suites are automatically created when you create a [check run](https://docs.github.com/rest/checks/runs). You only need to use this endpoint for manually creating check suites when you've disabled automatic creation using "[Update repository preferences for check suites](https://docs.github.com/rest/checks/suites#update-repository-preferences-for-check-suites)". Your GitHub App must have the `checks:write` permission to create check suites.

    def codeScanningDeleteAnalysis(self): pass
    # To call: gAPI.resource("repos").codeScanningDeleteAnalysis(owner=..., repo=..., analysis_id=..., ...)
    # Request: DELETE https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/analyses/{analysis_id}

    # Summary: Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository
    # Description:
    #   Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository. For
    #   private repositories, you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. For public repositories,
    #   you must use an access token with `public_repo` scope.
    #   GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.
    #
    #   You can delete one analysis at a time.
    #   To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
    #   Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
    #
    #   When you list the analyses for a repository,
    #   one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
    #
    #   ```
    #   "deletable": true
    #   ```
    #
    #   An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
    #   Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
    #   for each enabled code scanning tool,
    #   where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
    #
    #   * `ref`
    #   * `tool`
    #   * `category`
    #
    #   If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
    #   you'll get a 400 response with the message:
    #
    #   ```
    #   Analysis specified is not deletable.
    #   ```
    #
    #   The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
    #   two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
    #   `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
    #   Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
    #   in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
    #   for the specified tool in your repository.
    #   Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
    #   When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
    #   in the 200 response is `null`.
    #
    #   As an example of the deletion process,
    #   let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
    #   to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
    #   10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
    #   You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
    #   You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
    #   To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
    #   To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
    #   Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
    #   Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
    #   delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
    #   Then repeat the process for the second set.
    #   The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
    #
    #   **Outer loop**:
    #   * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
    #   * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
    #
    #     **Inner loop**:
    #     * Delete the identified analysis.
    #     * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
    #
    #   The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

    # Summary: Upload an analysis as SARIF data
    # Description:
    #   Uploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. You must use an access token with the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint for private repositories. You can also use tokens with the `public_repo` scope for public repositories only. GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint. For troubleshooting information, see "[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif)."
    #
    #   There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
    #    - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
    #    - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."
    #
    #   You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
    #
    #   ```
    #   gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0
    #   ```
    #   <br>
    #   SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
    #   To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries. For more information, see "[SARIF results exceed one or more limits](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif/results-exceed-limit)."

    # Description:
    #   Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.

    # Summary: Create a tree
    # Description:
    #   The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.
    #
    #   If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see "[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)" and "[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."

    #   access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
    #   to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues) webhook.
    #
    #   **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this

    # Description:
    #   Each type of source control system represents authors in a different way.

The GitHub Importer will make the author information valid, but the author might not be correct. For example, it will change the bare Subversion username `hubot` into something like `hubot <hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654>`.

    #
    #   **Import status**
    #
    #   This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
    #
    #   An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
    #
    #   *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
    #   *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
    #   *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
    #   *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
    #   *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
    #
    #   If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
    #
    #   *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
    #   *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
    #   *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
    #   *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
    #   *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
    #
    #   **The project_choices field**
    #
    #   When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
    #
    #   **Git LFS related fields**
    #
    #   This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
    #
    #   *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
    #   *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
    #   *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
    #   *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

    # Summary: Update an import
    # Description:
    #   An import can be updated with credentials or a project choice by passing in the appropriate parameters in this API
    #   request. If no parameters are provided, the import will be restarted.
    #
    #   Some servers (e.g. TFS servers) can have several projects at a single URL. In those cases the import progress will
    #   have the status `detection_found_multiple` and the Import Progress response will include a `project_choices` array.
    #   You can select the project to import by providing one of the objects in the `project_choices` array in the update request.
    #
    #   **Warning:** Support for importing Mercurial, Subversion and Team Foundation Version Control repositories will end
    #   on October 17, 2023. For more details, see [changelog](https://gh.io/github-importer-non-git-eol). In the coming weeks, we will update
    #   these docs to reflect relevant changes to the API and will contact all integrators using the "Source imports" API.

    #   Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not submitted and therefore do not include the `submitted_at` property in the response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the `event` parameter blank.

    #
    #   **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the _position_ of that line in the diff. The GitHub REST API offers the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests). To see a pull request diff, add this media type to the `Accept` header of a call to the [single pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request) endpoint.
    #
    #   The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

We recommend creating a review comment using `line`, `side`, and optionally `start_line` and `start_side` if your comment applies to more than one line in the pull request diff.
    #
    #   The `position` parameter is deprecated. If you use `position`, the `line`, `side`, `start_line`, and `start_side` parameters are not required.
    #
    #   **Note:** The position value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

    # Description:
    #   Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
    #
    #   Lists details of a pull request by providing its number.
    #
    #   When you get, [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls/#create-a-pull-request), or [edit](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#update-a-pull-request) a pull request, GitHub creates a merge commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
    #
    #   The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
    #
    #   The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
    #
    #   *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
    #   *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
    #   *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

    # Summary: Add a repository collaborator
    # Description:
    #   This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.
    #
    #   Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."
    #
    #   For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:
    #
    #   ```
    #   Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
    #   ```
    #
    #   Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."
    #
    #   The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [API](https://docs.github.com/rest/collaborators/invitations).
    #
    #   **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**
    #
    #   The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level changed.
    #
    #   **Rate limits**
    #
    #   You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

    # To call: gAPI.resource("repos").reposCompareCommits(owner=..., repo=..., basehead=..., ...)
    # Request: GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{basehead}

    # Summary: Compare two commits
    # Description:
    #   Compares two commits against one another. You can compare branches in the same repository, or you can compare branches that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections between repositories](https://docs.github.com/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."
    #
    #   This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order. You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
    #
    #   The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
    #
    #   When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.
    #
    #   **Working with large comparisons**
    #
    #   To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:
    #
    #   - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
    #   - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.
    #
    #   For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
    #
    #   **Signature verification object**
    #
    #   The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object includes the following fields:
    #
    #   | Name | Type | Description |
    #   | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
    #   | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
    #   | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
    #   | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
    #   | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
    #
    #   These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
    #
    #   | Value | Description |
    #   | ----- | ----------- |
    #   | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
    #   | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
    #   | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
    #   | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
    #   | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
    #   | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
    #   | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
    #   | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
    #   | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
    #   | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
    #   | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
    #   | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
    #   | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

    def reposCreateDeployment(self): pass
    # To call: gAPI.resource("repos").reposCreateDeployment(owner=..., repo=..., ...)
    # Request: POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/deployments

    # Summary: Create a deployment
    # Description:
    #   Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
    #
    #   The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
    #   before we merge a pull request.
    #
    #   The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
    #   multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
    #   makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
    #
    #   The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
    #   the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
    #   the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
    #   return a failure response.
    #
    #   By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
    #   state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
    #   specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
    #   not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
    #
    #   The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
    #   field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
    #
    #   The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
    #   be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an

    #   Merged branch response:
    #
    #   You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
    #   a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
    #   *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
    #   *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
    #   *   There are no merge conflicts
    #
    #   If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
    #   response.
    #
    #   Merge conflict response:
    #
    #   This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
    #   be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
    #
    #   Failed commit status checks:
    #
    #   This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
    #   status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

    # Summary: Create a repository dispatch event
    # Description:
    #   You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."
    #
    #   The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.
    #
    #   This endpoint requires write access to the repository by providing either:
    #
    #     - Personal access tokens with `repo` scope. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)" in the GitHub Help documentation.
    #     - GitHub Apps with both `metadata:read` and `contents:read&write` permissions.
    #
    #   This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.

    # Description:
    #   Creates a new repository using a repository template. Use the `template_owner` and `template_repo` route parameters to specify the repository to use as the template. If the repository is not public, the authenticated user must own or be a member of an organization that owns the repository. To check if a repository is available to use as a template, get the repository's information using the [Get a repository](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository) endpoint and check that the `is_template` key is `true`.
    #
    #   **OAuth scope requirements**
    #
    #   When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    #
    #   *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    #   *   `repo` scope to create a private repository

    # Summary: Delete a deployment
    # Description:
    #   If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment regardless of its status. If the repository has more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete a deployment.
    #
    #   To set a deployment as inactive, you must:
    #
    #   *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
    #   *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.
    #
    #   For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/statuses#create-a-deployment-status)."

    #
    #   You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the author.
    #
    #   The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.
    #
    #   You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.
    #
    #   **Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file contents](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

    # Summary: Get community profile metrics
    # Description:
    #   Returns all community profile metrics for a repository. The repository cannot be a fork.
    #
    #   The returned metrics include an overall health score, the repository description, the presence of documentation, the
    #   detected code of conduct, the detected license, and the presence of ISSUE\_TEMPLATE, PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE,
    #   README, and CONTRIBUTING files.

    #   The `health_percentage` score is defined as a percentage of how many of
    #   these four documents are present: README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, and
    #   CODE_OF_CONDUCT. For example, if all four documents are present, then
    #   the `health_percentage` is `100`. If only one is present, then the
    #   `health_percentage` is `25`.
    #
    #   `content_reports_enabled` is only returned for organization-owned repositories.

    @gAPI.resource_method("{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}", http_method="GET")
    def reposGetContent(self): pass
    # To call: gAPI.resource("repos").reposGetContent(owner=..., repo=..., path=..., ...)
    # Request: GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}

    # Summary: Get repository content
    # Description:
    #   Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory in `:path`. If you omit
    #   `:path`, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. See the description below regarding what the API response includes for directories.
    #
    #   Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types) for
    #   retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media
    #   type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types) to ensure the content is returned in a consistent
    #   object format.
    #
    #   **Notes**:
    #   *   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
    #   *   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees
    #   API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
    #    *  Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
    #    Size limits:
    #   If the requested file's size is:
    #   * 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
    #   * Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` [custom media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents#custom-media-types-for-repository-contents) are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
    #    * Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.
    #
    #    If the content is a directory:
    #   The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
    #   When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
    #   _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
    #   In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
    #
    #    If the content is a symlink:
    #   If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
    #   API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object
    #   describing the symlink itself.
    #
    #    If the content is a submodule:
    #   The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
    #   commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
    #   the submodule at that specific commit.
    #
    #   If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
    #   github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

    # Summary: Remove a repository collaborator
    # Description:
    #   Removes a collaborator from a repository.
    #
    #   To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.
    #
    #   This endpoint also:
    #   - Cancels any outstanding invitations
    #   - Unasigns the user from any issues
    #   - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization repositories.
    #   - Unstars the repository
    #   - Updates access permissions to packages
    #
    #   Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
    #    - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
    #    - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
    #    - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.
    #
    #   **Note**: A user can still have access to the repository through organization permissions like base repository permissions.
    #
    #   Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates might take some extra time to complete in the background.
    #
    #   For more information on fork permissions, see "[About permissions and visibility of forks](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks)".

    # Summary: Rename a branch
    # Description:
    #   Renames a branch in a repository.
    #
    #   **Note:** Although the API responds immediately, the branch rename process might take some extra time to complete in the background. You won't be able to push to the old branch name while the rename process is in progress. For more information, see "[Renaming a branch](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch)".
    #
    #   The permissions required to use this endpoint depends on whether you are renaming the default branch.
    #
    #   To rename a non-default branch:
    #
    #   * Users must have push access.
    #   * GitHub Apps must have the `contents:write` repository permission.
    #
    #   To rename the default branch:
    #
    #   * Users must have admin or owner permissions.
    #   * GitHub Apps must have the `administration:write` repository permission.

    # Summary: Update branch protection
    # Description:
    #   Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
    #
    #   Protecting a branch requires admin or owner permissions to the repository.
    #
    #   **Note**: Passing new arrays of `users` and `teams` replaces their previous values.
    #
    #   **Note**: The list of users, apps, and teams in total is limited to 100 items.

    # Summary: Upload a release asset
    # Description:
    #   This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
    #   the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
    #
    #   You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
    #
    #   Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:
    #
    #   `application/zip`
    #
    #   GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
    #   you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
    #
    #   When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
    #
    #   **Notes:**
    #   *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"

    # Summary: Search code
    # Description:
    #   Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).
    #
    #   When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).
    #
    #   For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:
    #
    #   `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`
    #
    #   This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.
    #
    #   Considerations for code search:
    #
    #   Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
    #
    #   *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
    #   *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
    #   *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
    #   language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.
    #
    #   This endpoint requires you to authenticate and limits you to 10 requests per minute.

    #
    #   For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.
    #
    #   `q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc`
    #
    #   This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the search results.
    #
    #   **Note:** For requests made by GitHub Apps with a user access token, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query. Requests that don't include the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` qualifier will receive an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. To get results for both issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for issues and pull requests. For more information about the `is` qualifier, see "[Searching only issues or pull requests](https://docs.github.com/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests)."

    #   the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
    #   request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

    # Summary: Restore package version for a user
    # Description:
    #   Restores a specific package version for a user.
    #
    #   You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:
    #     - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
    #     - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.
    #
    #   To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes. In addition:
    #   - If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, your token must also include the `repo` scope. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
    #   - If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, you must have admin permissions to the package whose version you want to restore. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

    # Description:
    #   Provides publicly available information about someone with a GitHub account.
    #
    #   GitHub Apps with the `Plan` user permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information about a user's GitHub plan. The GitHub App must be authenticated as a user. See "[Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/)" for details about authentication. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below"
    #
    #   The `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication).
    #
    #   The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly. For more information, see "[Emails API](https://docs.github.com/rest/users/emails)".
