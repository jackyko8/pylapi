# Features of PyLapi

- API Creation
  - Fully-automatic:
    - Generate Python API from OpenAPI specification
    - Inline API guide in the generated code
    - Zero-code: all you need is "pass"
  - Semi-automatic:
    - Manually rewrite or extend the auto-generated code
    - Generator embeds rewritten code into the API
    - Repeatable when changes occur in OpenAPI specification or rewritten code
  - Manual creationg of API when no OpenAPI specification available
    - Integrate multiple APIs into a single Python API class
    - One-line classes and methods (zero-code approach)
    - Abstraction of common methods in root API class
- Resource framework
  - Resource as a data object (`load`)
  - Request and response auto-rewrite (`send` and `give`)
